# NeuralNote
A Python program that displays Interactive evolutionary computation for sound. 

Designed to be run from the console. 

The user is presented with a series of random notes to start. 

They then select between these series of notes. This series is taken, and slightly mutated.

The user is then presented with three new note series, the one they just selected, a new slightly modified version, and a very modified version. 

The user repeats this to produce interesting sets of notes.
